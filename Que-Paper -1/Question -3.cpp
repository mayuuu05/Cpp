//3. Define a base class `Shape` with private attributes `color` and `area`. 
//Implement public member functions for setting and getting the color and calculating the area.
// Derive two classes, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, from the `Shape` class.
//  Implement methods to calculate the area specific to each shape.
//   Demonstrate abstraction by calling the area calculation methods for both `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
