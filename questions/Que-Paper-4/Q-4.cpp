//4. Extend the `Device` hierarchy from Question 3 to include a virtual function `calculateDiscount()`.
// Implement the `calculateDiscount()` function in each derived class to calculate a discount based on certain criteria.
//  Create an array of `Device` pointers, pointing to objects of different devices.
// Demonstrate polymorphism by calling the `calculateDiscount()` function for each object.
