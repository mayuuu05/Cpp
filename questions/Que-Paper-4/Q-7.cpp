//7. Define an abstract class `Animal` with pure virtual functions `makeSound()` and `move()`. 
//Implement concrete/normal classes `Lion` and `Fish` that inherit from `Animal`.
// Demonstrate polymorphism by creating an array of `Animal` pointers pointing to objects of both `Lion` and `Fish`.
// Call the `makeSound()` and `move()` functions for each object.
