//4. Extend the `Shape` hierarchy from Question 3 to include a virtual function `displayDetails()`. 
//Implement the `displayDetails()` function in each derived class to print information specific to the shape.
// Create an array of `Shape` pointers, pointing to objects of different shapes.
// Demonstrate polymorphism by calling the `displayDetails()` function for each object.
