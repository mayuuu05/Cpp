//7. Define an abstract class `Vehicle` with pure virtual functions `startEngine()` and `drive()`. 
//Implement concrete classes `Car` and `Bike` that inherit from `Vehicle`. 
//Demonstrate polymorphism by creating an array of `Vehicle` pointers, pointing to objects of both `Car`
// and `Bike`. Call the `startEngine()` and `drive()` functions for each object.
