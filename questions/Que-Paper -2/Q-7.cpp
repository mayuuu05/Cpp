//7. Define an abstract class `Shape` with pure virtual functions `calculateArea()` and `draw()`.
// Implement concrete/normal classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit from `Shape`. 
// Demonstrate polymorphism by creating an array of `Shape` pointers pointing to objects of both `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
// Call the `calculateArea()` and `draw()` functions for each object.
