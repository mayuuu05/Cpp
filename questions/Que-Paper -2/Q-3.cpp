//3. Define a base class `Vehicle` with private attributes `model` and `speed`. 
//Implement public member functions for setting and getting these attributes.
// Derive two classes, `Car` and `Bike`, from the `Vehicle` class. Implement 
// methods to calculate the time taken for a certain distance based on the speed of each vehicle.
// Demonstrate abstraction by calling the time calculation methods for both `Car` and `Bike`.
